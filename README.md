# stg
A simple simulator of the syntetic turbulence generator 
by Shur et al., Flow Turbulence and Combustion (2004) 

There are few things, which are not implemented: 
1) function to find the wave number corresponding to the spectral maximum
2) function to find the max local scale of the most energy containg eddies
3) not sure that mapping of the wave space on the spatialtemporal Fourier space is fully correct - TBD !
